All feedback is welcome and appreciated!

Lessons learned from this project:
-Be careful editing files in github. A pull is required when you work on your local machine.
-Variables are stored based on their scope. If a variable is not working how you would like it to, check where it is declared.
-While integers and decimals are both 'numbers' in JS, when parsing a DOM element dont forget that ints are still different from floats
